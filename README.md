The YouRanTube site is a website developed to provide an alternative to the random video sites on YouTube.
YouRanTube therefore offers you, thanks to your own YouTube API key and the ChannelID of the desired YouTube channel, to randomly retrieve a YouTube video.

Except that on random video sites, the search is limited by the query to the last 50 videos, so YouRanTube tries to override this limit and offer a search among all the videos in a YouTube channel.
